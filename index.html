        <h1>Raspberry Pi Guard</h1>
        <p>A modern Pi based security camera system. If you&#39;re tired of blackbox solutions that at best upload snapshots on some proprietary cloud service this is for you: more features, fully open, cheaper, extensible.</p>

<a id="why" class="anchor" href="#why" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why</h2>

<p>If you need a security camera system today these are your options:</p>

<ul>
<li>pick from a flooded market of cheap stuff that will fail on you when you need it most</li>
<li>a midrange class of cameras costing $150+ that will do a little more</li>
<li>some really expensive stuff ($300+)</li>
</ul>

<p>However even some of the more expensive models are still pretty dumb, doing at best some basic motion detection and uploading videos to proprietary cloud services. To add functionalities you will need additional proprietary control center devices and software (although zoneminder can be an option).</p>

<p><strong>But the biggest problem still, you're locked in with a bunch of black boxes.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Want to turn on the light in the house when your porch camera detects motion? not possible.</li>
<li>Want to get called on the phone if the front door is open? not possible.</li>
<li>Want to get your videos straight to dropbox or gdrive right after the fact? not possible.</li>
<li><strong>Want to add anything custom at all? not possible.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>With the advent of the Raspberry Pi camera we thought it should be possible to build a better security camera. However it's not as easy as slapping the camera on the pi and installing something like Motion. That might work if you're trying to record the neighbor stealing your mail, but won't cut it for anything more serious.</p>

<h2>
<a id="what--features" class="anchor" href="#what--features" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What / Features</h2>

<p>Build a high grade security camera that's capable of:</p>

<ul>
<li>day and night vision (infrared)</li>
<li>motion detection at 1080p 30fps</li>
<li>additional PIR sensor for extra motion detection accuracy</li>
<li>face detection</li>
<li>record high quality videos of intrusions (1080p 30fps)</li>
<li>interface with whatever storage service (cloud or not) you might have for archival</li>
<li>package an extra SSD card for reliable local large storage</li>
<li>provide an api to interface the camera to other sensors and services</li>
<li>integrate the camera with 3rd party services such as twilio to alert you via sms or phone call</li>
<li>battery backed so that cutting power won't disable the camera</li>
<li>pan/tilt/zoom support</li>
</ul>
